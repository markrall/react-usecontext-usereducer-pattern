Learning how to do something new and learning how to do it well are two very different things.

A lot of the learning I've done via Udemy has focused on the use of React classes. I'm taking the bet that most organisations are moving to the use of functional components and Hooks.

Having followed a couple of online tutorials, I've been wanting to embed my knowledge of hooks, useEffect, useState, useReducer and useContext more deeply.

Inspired by an [article](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/the-state-reducer-pattern-with-react-hooks) from Kent C. Dodds, I've been working through how to use the state reducer pattern using a contrived counter example.
